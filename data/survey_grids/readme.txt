Description of shapefiles for GOA survey

@ RACE_GF(\\akc0ss-n086)(G:)\AI-GOA\shapefiles there are several maps of interest for the Gulf of Alaska survey area:
GOAdissolved = polygon with extent of GOA survey area, land and everything else included
GOAdissolved_erase = same as above, but minus land
goagrid_nolandsandman = goa survey grid minus land, sandman reef, and any other permanent holidays on the map
goagrid_landuntrawlsndmn = this shape is only those grid cells from the goagrid polygon [a2(\\ofisgis)(u:)\alaska\constructs\zones\strata] that are "untrawlable" as determined by survey observations OR are assigned STRATUM = 0 which means they are on land or they are within one of the permanent holidays in the survey area (e.g., Sandman Reef).
